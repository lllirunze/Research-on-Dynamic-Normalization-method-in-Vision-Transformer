## Research on Dynamic Normalization method in Vision Transformer

## Abstract

The dynamic feature normalization method of Transformer model is studied from the aspect of model regularization. It is proposed to use feature normalization instead of traditional layer normalization to achieve explicit Token value normalization and accelerate model convergence. Combined with the idea of parameter reorganization, a dynamic learnable feature normalization is proposed to improve the flexibility and computational efficiency of feature normalization.
